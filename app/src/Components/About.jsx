      <h3>My quick story</h3>
       <>
      <span>Since my early days at 11 years old, building web stuff has been my passion.</span>
      It all started with Geocities, where I created sites to host Flash animations for friends. 
      As the digital landscape evolved, so did my skills – from crafting fan-club websites with Dreamweaver to
       making MySpace pages pop with my HTML and CSS abilities. 
       <span>That same drive for creation and design has never left me.</span>
      </>
      <p>My journey has taken me through various creative and technical realms – from music and photography to
         sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production,
         VR games, to immersive 3D sound experiences.</p> <br />

         <p>In recent years, my professional focus has shifted significantly towards software development. Ive 
          had the privilege of working with senior developers and designers, absorbing invaluable insights into 
          what makes a product truly stand out.</p>
           <h1>As a developer</h1>
           <p>
      <span>My coding ethos is centered on clarity and accessibility.</span>
      Initially, I build to ensure functionality, but I dedicate considerable effort to refining my code - commenting, organizing, and ensuring 
      it is welcoming to any collaborator. Mi casa es tu casa in the world of code.
       <span>That same drive for creation and design has never left me.</span>
